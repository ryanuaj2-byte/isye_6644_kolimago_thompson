    "The main findings of a project will clearly depend on what type of project you’re doing, how \n",
    "many people are in the group, etc.  Here are some guidelines related to the broad categories \n",
    "from the original project list document: \n",
    " \n",
    "Applications-Oriented “Real-World” Problems.  These projects will typically involve \n",
    "simulation using a simulation language like Arena (though you may have to use something like \n",
    "Python for, e.g., simulation of pandemic flu spread).  Here are our expectations: \n",
    "• Describe in detail the applications area (e.g., all the potential ways that you can play with \n",
    "an inventory policy, why it’s important, etc.). \n",
    "• Collect some data from someplace – e.g., an actual company, get it yourself, find it online, \n",
    "or (in an emergency) make it up, but with justification.  \n",
    "• Do an elementary data analysis and maybe some curve fitting, if appropriate. \n",
    "• Simulate your model (e.g., in Arena), hopefully using the data analysis you undertook. \n",
    "• Analyze the output, make improvements/conclusions. \n",
    "Language- and Modeling-Oriented Problems.  These projects usually involve learning a \n",
    "new simulation language or modeling paradigm. We’d like you to: \n",
    "• Explain how the language works (at least at a basic level).  \n",
    "• Provide a tutorial / user guide with your own examples (please do not use the examples \n",
    "found in the online documentation).  \n",
    "• Outline good points and not-so-good points. \n",
    "• Make a very quick comparison with Arena. \n",
    "Programming-Oriented Problems.  These problems are often concerned with Monte \n",
    "Carlo analysis of a game or preparing an easy-to-use library for some simulation functionality \n",
    "for us. \n",
    "• Describe the problem at hand thoroughly and past efforts by others to solve it. \n",
    "• Develop and document your code. \n",
    "• Show how to run your program(s). \n",
    "• Give illustrations of what you can learn from your code (e.g., whether a PRN generator is \n",
    "any good, or whether a certain strategy will work better than others in blackjack).  Make \n",
    "sure to be statistically rigorous (e.g., estimates, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, etc.) \n",
    "if you’re carrying out Monte Carlo experiments. \n",
    "Theory-Oriented Problems \n",
    "• Describe the problem at hand thoroughly and past efforts by others to solve it. \n",
    "• What are the techniques used to derive the main findings? \n",
    "• Describe some of the fundamental results (e.g., this paper gives an explicit expression for \n",
    "an estimator’s expected value in terms of the covariance function). \n",
    "• Formulate (but you don’t have to solve) a couple of research problems that might be \n",
    "derived from this work. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next few un-pointed sections are the title sections from one of the \"good\" project examples, the one that most resembled what we're doing."
